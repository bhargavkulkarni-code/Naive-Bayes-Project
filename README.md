Problem statement – the telecom churn dataset has information about Id, gender, senior citizen, married, tenure, phone service, multiple lines, internet service, tech support, streaming TV, movies, contract, paperless billing, payment method, monthly charges, total charges, churn. In this dataset find dependent and independent variables and write codes for naïve bayes by taking training size =70% and remaining for testing and check the accuracy.



Tools used – pandas, sklearn, label encoder, naïve bayes.



Outcome – the accuracy of naïve bayes algorithm is 73%. And 22 and 6 these are true positive classes and 8 and 2 these are false positive classes. Precision 0.750 is highest, recall 0.917 is highest, f1 score 0.815 is highest.
